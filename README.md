# Creative Tone.js and React Project

This is a react app using the Tone.js library to allow creating audio in a webpage. This webpage is like a rudimentary midi controller with some scales of notes being created by an FM Synthesizer, a drum pad, and a few toggleable effects. The notes are labeled with the coinciding key to press on the keyboard in order to play it. I recommend turning off num lock so you can use the num pad to play the drum pad and turn on effects. Multiple effects can be stacked and press 0 to turn them off if the sound quality gets too bad or too loud. 

The synth can become distorted really easily if you are pressing too many buttons at the same time

This is my first time using Tone.js or React and my first time really working with node.js frameworks for webdesign.
